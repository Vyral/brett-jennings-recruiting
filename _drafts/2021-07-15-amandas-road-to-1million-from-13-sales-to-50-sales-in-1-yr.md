Over the last 12 years, I’ve traveled the country to meet with and mentor some of the brightest minds in the real estate industry. The Agent on Fire series is about discovering amazing Realtors and helping them grow. I’m committed to helping 10 agents earn $1 million in GCI this year. I recently had the privilege to speak with two amazing agents: Amanda Vang and Michael Saldana. Amanda is on track for over 50 sales in 2021 and still maintains a healthy work-life balance. They’re both well on their way to that $1 million goal.

If you’d like to discuss the topics covered in today’s video or want to schedule a strategy session on how to improve your business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Also,&nbsp;**our team is growing and we’re looking for top-quality agents to join us.**&nbsp;If you’re interested in this opportunity, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.

  about_markdown: >-
    Brett Jennings is the owner and founder of Brett Jennings Real Estate
    Experts. Brett is an award-winning luxury home marketing specialist and also
    holds a certificate in negotiation from Harvard Law. In 2017, the Wall
    Street Journal recognized Brett and his team as one of the top 250 real
    estate groups in the United States. With over one million agents in the
    country, this prestigious award places Brett in the top 1/10th of the top 1%
    among his peers.


    Although these statistics are impressive, Brettâ€™s true passion is helping
    people make smart real estate decisions that positively transform their
    lives. His extensive background in real estate, finance, and life coaching
    enables him to draw from a deep well of life experience as he helps his
    clients make informed, intelligent decisions. In a fluctuating real estate
    landscape, the expertise and attention he provides are necessary and rare.


    Described by his peers and clients as energetic, focused, determined, and
    engaged, Brett always goes above and beyond. He provides his buyers access
    to his curated list of over 250 off-market properties, and his sellers
    benefit from his market-proven home selling process that has set
    record-breaking prices in almost every neighborhood he sells in. His
    best-selling book, The New Rise in Real Estate, serves as a further resource
    for clients wanting to make the most of the current market.

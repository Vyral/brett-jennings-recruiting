Although it looks like we’re headed for another COVID lockdown where many businesses and real estate agents will slow down, my guest in today’s video is on fire: Ryan Nickell. **Ryan’s been with The Real Experts team for a little over a month, and in that time, he’s embraced everything we have to offer.** He leaned into our onboarding process, mastered the CRM, took advantage of Zillow Flex, and leveraged our marketing team to optimize his sphere of influence. In the week leading up to the recording of this video, he closed six deals, so it’s high time we spotlighted his success. Last year at his previous brokerage, he did 18 deals total, and his goal for 2021 is to double his business and help 36 families.&nbsp;

Now that he’s created this momentum and we’re helping him reach the next level in his career, what’s his advice for agents who are looking to create a great 2021? Make the calls, work with your marketing team, reach out to your sphere, and work with your referrals too. Having tons of inbound calls coming in has been helpful to him as well in terms of getting more opportunities to tour homes with buyers.&nbsp;

Additionally, instead of resting during the holidays, now is the time for agents to lean into the end of 2020. **While other agents are taking time off, you can gain market shares.**&nbsp;

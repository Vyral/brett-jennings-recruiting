Don isnât directly part of my team, but heâs able to take advantage of all the leverage, leads, systems, and support we offer. Donâs goal is to help 40 families move this year, and heâs already well on his way to that objective.âSince Don joined the Real Estate Experts, his business has been exploding!âDon says it doesnât matter how long youâve been in the business, as long as youâre coachable. If you can understand and then implement the systems youâre taught, it works wonderfully. âDonât worry about being perfect,â he says. âRight now is about making things happen.â I know Don is going to reach his goals this year!If youâre considering growing your business, thatâs what we want to help you do. If youâre currently doing between five and 20 deals per year and you want to make between 15 and 50 deals per year, thatâs achievable.

The story of our meeting began when she happened to be renting a vacation property that I own in Lake Tahoe. As a result, we forged a friendship and she decided to break into real estate.Â Just five months into full production, sheâs already closed 13 transactions to the tune of $15 million in business and is on pace to close an amazing 30 transactions by the end of 2019. Â  Â  Â Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in our interview. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure:Â 1:58âWhat was Kelly doing before getting into real estate and what led her to pursue this new path?Â 4:30âWhat was her first position with the team?Â 6:12âHow many real estate-related conversations did Kelly have versus the number of people she called in her first month?Â 7:08âWhat ultimately inspired Kelly to join our team?Â 8:22âHow much was uncertainty a factor for Kelly in the beginning? How did she persevere in spite of those feelings?Â 9:37âWhere does she foresee her career in real estate headed? What life goals have been made possible thanks to this new direction?Â 11:45âHow has Kellyâs experience been in the culture weâve worked to foster?Â 13:45âIn closing, what can Kelly most attribute to her success and personal growth?Â Thanks for tuning in for this segment in our âAgent Successâ series, and I appreciate Kelly taking some time to share her experience working with our team so far!Â If youâd like more information on how you can double your business year over year and youâre trying to get to the next level, go ahead and surf through our blog.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How can you move from being a real estate agent to becoming the CEO of your own business? Iâve done it myself, and Iâd like to show you how you can do it too.The journey took about three years, and Iâve grown from $3 million in production to over $165 million. My mentor, who made 300 sales each year compared to my 15, told me that the problems start with EID: entrepreneurial idiot disease.Â 80% of real estate is 20$ to 25$ per hour work. If you relegate yourself to doing these low-cost tasks, you only have 20% of your time that you can spend doing the $200-per-hour work.You need to figure out what your time is worth by creating your income goals. Letâs say you want to make $500,000 a year. 40 hours per week for 50 weeks is 2,000 hours. Divide $500,000 by 2,000 and you get an amount of $250 an hour. Therefore, anything thatâs not worth $250 an hour should be off your plate.âIf you relegate yourself to doing these low-cost tasks, you only have 20% of your time that you can spend doing the $200-per-hour work.âNext, we introduce leverage by getting other people to work for you. To effectively grow your business, you need a great administrative staff to coordinate transactions. You want a full-time admin once you hit 15 to 20 transactions.Â After this, you need predictable, scalable lead generation. Most agents only utilize open houses and spheres of influence, but you need to create farms and use the internet to find leads. If you have an admin team and lead generation techniques in place, youâll be ready to add agents to your business and become a CEO. And since youâre driving business to these agents, theyâll stay loyal to you.If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Here are seven strategies you can use to help your buyers win out in a multiple-offer situation:Â 1. Know the market. By this I mean you need to study the recent comparable sales and, more importantly, the most recent pending sales.Â 2. Go big or go homeless. Obviously, you want to make an offer thatâs higher than the last known comparable pending sale. If there were four offers on a recent pending sale, that means three buyers who lost out on the home will be looking to offer a higher price the next time around.Â 3. Consider using an escalation clause. This is an addendum to your clientâs purchase agreement that guarantees theyâll offer a higher price than the next highest offer up to a certain amount. Talk to the listing agent before you use this clause, though, because some agents have never seen it before and might not understand how it works.Â âIn a quick market like ours, the first person to the party is often the winner.â4. Waive as many contingencies as possible. Get your buyer pre-approved before they make an offer so that they arenât carrying any loan or appraisal contingencies with them. Many sellers in the Bay Area also do pre-inspections, so if you and your client are comfortable trusting a pre-inspection, you can waive your own inspection contingency. If the seller hasnât done a pre-inspection, you can still get the inspection contingency waived by asking the listing agent to have it done prior to making your offer.Â 5. Put down a huge earnest money deposit. A customary earnest money deposit in our area is 3% of the purchase price. If your buyer has the funds, have them put down 10%. Your clientâs not taking on any more risk, because the liquidated damages clause maximizes liquidated damages at 3%.6. Write a love letter to the seller. Writing a love letter has helped our teamâs clients win out in a multiple-offer situation even when they didnât offer the highest price. Have your client include pictures of their own family, and if possible, have them shoot a quick video on their phone that you can then text or email the listing agent.Â 7. Create urgency. In a quick market like ours, the first person to the party is often the winner. With that in mind, consider sending a pre-emptive offer to the listing agent. They have an obligation to show the seller that offer, so you donât need to ask permission.Â If you have any more questions about how to come out on top in a multiple-offer situation, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you.",

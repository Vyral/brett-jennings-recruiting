        <title>The Journey From Agent to CEO: How to Grow From 10 -130 Deals per Year</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6tNieQEskM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you move from being a real estate agent to becoming the CEO of your own business? &lt;strong&gt;I’ve done it myself, and I’d like to show you how you can do it too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey took about three years, and I’ve grown from $3 million in production to over $165 million. My mentor, who made 300 sales each year compared to my 15, told me that the problems start with EID: entrepreneurial idiot disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80% of real estate is 20$ to 25$ per hour work.&lt;/strong&gt; If you relegate yourself to doing these low-cost tasks, you only have 20% of your time that you can spend doing the $200-per-hour work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to figure out what your time is worth by creating your income goals. Let’s say you want to make $500,000 a year. 40 hours per week for 50 weeks is 2,000 hours. Divide $500,000 by 2,000 and you get an amount of $250 an hour. Therefore, anything that’s not worth $250 an hour should be off your plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you relegate yourself to doing these low-cost tasks, you only have 20% of your time that you can spend doing the $200-per-hour work.%20localhost:4000/the-journey-from-agent-to-ceo-how-to-grow-from-10-130-deals-per-year.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you relegate yourself to doing these low-cost tasks, you only have 20% of your time that you can spend doing the $200-per-hour work.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next, we introduce leverage by getting other people to work for you.&lt;/strong&gt; To effectively grow your business, you need a great administrative staff to coordinate transactions. You want a full-time admin once you hit 15 to 20 transactions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After this, you need predictable, scalable lead generation.&lt;/strong&gt; Most agents only utilize open houses and spheres of influence, but you need to create farms and use the internet to find leads. If you have an admin team and lead generation techniques in place, you’ll be ready to add agents to your business and become a CEO. And since you’re driving business to these agents, they’ll stay loyal to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Success Spotllight - Tony Fery:  How to Go From 0 to 36 Deals a Year</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMZSveqnky8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Episode 2 of our “Agent Success” series! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series, I hold interviews with some of our team’s up-and-coming stars in the sphere of real estate and pick their brain about their journey—where they come from, their challenges along the way, and where they’re headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, I’m super excited to introduce today’s guest: Tony Fery. Our friendship actually predates his emergence in real estate, and as someone fairly new to the industry, he’s already on pace to do 36 transactions this year alone. He’s certainly proven to be an asset to our team.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in our interview. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:40—Where was Tony before cracking into real estate? What caused him to take the leap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:07—What was Tony’s transition into real estate like? How did it help him once he launched?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:02—What kind of success did Tony have in those first six months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:05—When he faced some obstacles in his business, what allowed him to persevere? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13:01—How did Tony use the “Future Self” tool to identify who he wanted to be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14:53—What business does Tony currently have in the pipeline? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16:40—With all of Tony’s commitments, how is his mindset now different from when he started? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22:10—What possibilities and aspirations does Tony foresee for his future in real estate? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23:12—What final words can Tony offer to others? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for tuning in for this segment in our “Agent Success” series! &lt;/p&gt;

It’s time once again to highlight a couple of “Experts on Fire” in our interview series: Haleem Ballou and Elva Robledo. Haleem has not only tripled his business this year, but he’s also cleared $1 million in GCI. Haleem knew he was going to have a career way back in college, and he’s really grabbed the bull by the horns. Elva didn’t know her path at first and started her career on the back-end of things.

Haleem's and Elva's story is amazing. If you have any questions about them or real estate in general, feel free to call or email us. We'd love to chat.

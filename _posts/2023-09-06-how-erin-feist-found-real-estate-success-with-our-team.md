Today, we’re thrilled to be speaking with one of the newest members of our team, Erin Feist! She’s been an agent for about two years now, and her growth has been like a rocket ship so far. Despite her relatively short time in the business, **Erin is now one of the best real estate agents in the Bay Area.** In this conversation, we’ll discuss how she got started in real estate, how she’s found success in the business, why she joined our team, and more.&nbsp;

As always, don’t hesitate to call or email us with any questions about our team or something else. We look forward to hearing from you!

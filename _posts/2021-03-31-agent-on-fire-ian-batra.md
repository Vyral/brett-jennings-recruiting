In today’s episode of “Agent on Fire,” I’m excited to catch up with Ian Batra, an amazing team leader who has led his team through the challenges of last year to a place of massive success in 2021. Obviously, the pandemic shook things up for all of us in 2020, but nevertheless,&nbsp; Ian, his wife Laura, and their team rounded out the year with more than $20 million in sales. We’re only a few months into the new year, but they’ve already doubled what they did all of last year—as of the night before this video was recorded, they had $41 million in sales volume\! Today we’ll hear what tools, procedures, and systems they’ve used to amass such great success even in the face of adversity.

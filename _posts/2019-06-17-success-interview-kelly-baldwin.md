Welcome to Episode No. 3 of our “Agent Success” series\!&nbsp;

Today I have the great privilege of sitting down with and shining the spotlight on Kelly Baldwin. The story of our meeting began when she happened to be renting a vacation property that I own in Lake Tahoe. As a result, we forged a friendship and she decided to break into real estate.&nbsp;

Just five months into full production, she’s already closed 13 transactions to the tune of $15 million in business and is on pace to close an amazing 30 transactions by the end of 2019. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

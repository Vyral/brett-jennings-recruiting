Today I’m checking in with real estate agent Ryan LaRocca. We’re discussing his success and what he was able to accomplish over the last year by building a team. Many agents get to a point where they can’t get more than a certain number of units sold per year on their own, so building a team is a great option. By building a team, Ryan has essentially doubled his business year over year. Now, almost anything is possible for his excellent crew. To learn how he did it, watch our full conversation.

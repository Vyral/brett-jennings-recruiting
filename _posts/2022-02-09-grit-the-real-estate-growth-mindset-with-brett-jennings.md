Brett Jennings got into real estate right after the market crashed in 2008. At that time, he saw an opportunity doing short sales and foreclosures, which gave him the experience necessary to understand the value of leverage and importance of building a team.

Yet, Brett knew that he couldn’t do short sales and foreclosures forever. So even before the market turned a couple of years later, he was already looking for his next niche opportunity. That’s when he shifted his focus into building a real estate team.

He worked the real estate team model successfully for about 6 years until he started to recognize that it also has limitations. The people he hired, trained, and supported eventually wanted to get a higher split, have their own identity, and build their own brand.

Although the situation left Brett feeling frustrated and betrayed, he wanted to know if it’s possible to create a team environment for these people, and still be in a relationship with them. This ultimately led to the “teamerage” (team+brokerage) model.

Today, Brett Jennings is a Founder, Award-Winning REALTOR®, and Luxury Home Marketing Expert at Real Estate Experts. He is a best-selling author and is recognized as one of the top 1,000 agents in the country.

Let’s hear from Brett as he shares his journey from being a solo agent to building a team, then eventually landing on this hybrid model of a “teamerage”, which has enabled him to scale and grow his annual production from $124 million in 2019 to $1.2 billion in 2021.

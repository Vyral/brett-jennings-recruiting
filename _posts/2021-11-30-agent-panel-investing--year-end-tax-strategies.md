On this edition of our “Top Agent Panel,” we’re back for another insightful and educational discussion. This time, we’re talking all about investing and year-end tax strategies. I’m joined by top agents Aaron West and Daniel Del Real or PMZ Real Estate, as well as Jeremiah Boucher of Patriot Holdings, to get their expert insight into the best tips and tricks. Most people get into real estate to eventually get out of it, and we’ll cover the wealth-building strategies that you need to get there.

If you have any questions, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!

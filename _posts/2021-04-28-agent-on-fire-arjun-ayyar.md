In this episode of “Agent on Fire,” I sat down to interview none other than Arjun Ayyar to discuss his journey from being on a team at the start of his career to eventually building his own team. In just a year, Arjun is now doing as much business in a single quarter as he used to do in a whole year, so today we’ll learn about what changes he had to make to form his team and make such a monumental leap in business.

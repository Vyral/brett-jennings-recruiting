Want to double your appointments and closings in 2025 without working double the hours? The game has changed. Top agents are now using AI-powered tools to automatically identify motivated clients, book more appointments, deliver stunning reports & presentations and sharpen their sales skills—all while closing more deals.<br><br>Just last year, our agents were struggling with cold leads and tight inventory. Today, they’re tripling their listings thanks to AI systems that work 24/7 to find and qualify the best opportunities.

Here’s what separates the winners from the rest in today’s market: AI doesn’t just save time; it uncovers hidden leads before they’re ready, crafts personalized outreach at scale, and even handles initial conversations through smart chatbots.

While other agents are chasing dead-end leads, you could be sitting across from ready-to-sell homeowners who were pre-qualified by an AI assistant. Here are four powerful ways AI is helping real estate agents improve their skills, win more listings, work smarter, and stay ahead of the curve.<br><br>**1\.** **AI for lead generation.** Systems like Fello and Ruuster can actually scan your database and online activity to figure out which contacts are most likely to buy or sell next and even message out to them with compelling offers, like a cash offer for their home, a home valuation or if they’re buying, homes that might be of interest, to engage and start a conversation. It’s like having a crystal ball of who’s buying or selling next, and an assistant that’s reaching out to them. . Instead of guessing or cold calling your entire list, you can focus on the people who are most likely to engage or already showing signs they’re ready to move. It saves time, cuts out the guesswork, and helps you have better conversations with leads that are actually worth your effort.

**2\. AI listing presentation tools.** These days, more agents are running listing presentations virtually—and for good reason. With tools like Zoom, Kaydoh & Revive AI, it’s easy to guide sellers through a clean, professional presentation without having to meet in person. You can include market data, visuals, and even a pre-recorded walk-through, all tailored to their needs. Revive AI is one I really like because it wows clients and gives us the ability to provide them multiple solutions that most agents aren’t offering. With just 10 interior and exterior photos, we can provide the homeowner with 4 options for their home, including a cash offer, and as-is on the market offer, and If they’re home needs work, the approximate cost of renovation and how much return on investment they will get from renovating. Sellers appreciate the insight, especially when trying to get the most money for their home. It’s a smarter, more modern way to present—and it helps you stand out in a crowded market.

**3\. AI for Personalized & automated follow-up.** Following up with leads doesn’t have to mean writing every email from scratch or setting endless reminders. Tools like FollowUpBoss, and Homebot make it easy to stay in touch with messages that actually feel personal and with embedded AI message drafting, a text and email follow-up message takes 10 seconds, not 10 minutes. Whether it’s a quick check-in, a neighborhood market update, or even a birthday note, these systems help you do it—at the right time and with the right tone. It helps you stay top of mind without adding more to your plate. Consistent contact leads to more responses, stronger relationships, and more listings down the line.<br><br>**4\.** **AI for Sales Coaching.** Remember this: amateurs practice until they get it right well while pros practice until they never get it wrong,

If you want to get paid like a pro, you have to train like a pro……and this is where Maverick is amazing.

Maverick is like having a world-class sales coach at your disposal 24/7. It’s an AI roleplay bot, but really think of it like a pitching machine if you were a baseball player.

You call into Maverick and select one of several scenarios: a seller, a buyer, an expired listing, or sphere of influence, and you’ll start a conversation with the goal of setting an appointment. Maverick will then score your call and coach you on how and where you could have improved your scripting and sales skills.

Agents who spend 30 minutes a day on Maverick are quadrupling their appointment rate because they’re simply getting much better at what to say when they actually get someone on the phone.

This is great because the hardest part of real estate is getting into conversation, and if you’re five times better when you actually talk to prospective clients, you can 5X your business<br><br>If you’re looking to sell more homes and grow your business, let’s connect!

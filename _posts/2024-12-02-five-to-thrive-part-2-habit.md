[**REGISTER HERE FOR OUR 5 TO THRIVE IN 2025 EVENT ON DECEMBER 11TH**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/top-agent-secrets-5-keys-to-thrive-in-2025-tickets-1083491565439?aff=oddtdtcreator){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Welcome back to the Five to Thrive in ‘25 where we’re talking about the five things you have to get right to thrive in 2025.

In a recap of our last session, we said the first thing you have to get right is your mindset. Starting with a positive mindset and then developing a growth mindset can help you see how clarity is power. Setting clear goals will focus your energy and drive you to make sure you hit them because 80% of your success starts right here.

But once we’ve got our mindset right, then it’s about getting your habits right. As human beings we are creatures of habit and your habits are either taking you closer or taking you further away from your goals.

So what habits do you need to instill that will virtually guarantee your success?

Well, the first foundation has nothing to do with business and is all about about YOU. Because you are the source of your business you need to be tuned up and ready to go every day to achieve your goals.

So the first habit you want to instill is designed to keep your energy high and your attitude positive

And that habit is to simply take your meds every day, Did I just say take meds?

Yes, I’m advocating taking your meds daily, but the meds I’m talking about aren’t in caffeine Adderall, or Zoloft meds. The meds Im talking about here are meditation, exercise, diet, and sleep.

Why are these meds so important?

First is meditation. If you have never sincerely tried to implement a practice of meditation for 15 to 20 minutes of silence daily I’m telling you from experience it was one of the sublist but most powerful personal development practices I’ve added to my routine that changed my life. There are a couple of great apps out there you can utilize one’s called Headspace and the other is called Calm so give those a try. But if you’re looking for a deeper experience at the beginning of 2025 I will be leading a six-week intro to meditation series you can plug into absolutely free.

The second is exercise, which is pretty obvious. Everyone knows how good you feel after a great workout and the truth is our body responds to the energy demands we put on it. Getting a 30 to 60 minute workout 3 to 5 times a week will change your energy game.

Third, is diet. Just simply don’t eat like an idiot. Eating a healthy diet with limited to no processed foods is going to help you keep that energy high.

And the last one is sleep. Again, this is super simple and not always easy with the demands of Real Estate, but getting seven hours a night will put you in an optimum condition to get after your goals.

Now, once you’ve taken your meds and you have that foundational habit in place, let’s talk about the habit for your business.

To keep this simple you only need to remember one word to instill the habits necessary in your business and that word is the actual word HABIT.

And I’m telling you from experience I’ve coached hundreds of agents and dozens of agents to become million-dollar-plus earners and for those that keep this as their focus, everything else takes care of itself.

Let’s unpack the word HABIT.

H is to hunt for new opportunities. Every day you have to block out at least one hour or more for prospecting and guess what it doesn’t have to be cold calling, but it does have to be some type of active business generation whether it is door knocking, calling, networking, DM’ing people on social, it is the active pursuit to start and create conversations with new people about real estate.

A is for activating new opportunities. This is spending at least one hour a day following up on existing opportunities or people who you’ve been in contact with who said that they are making a move and Real Estate somewhere between now and the next 18 months.

B is to build your market knowledge. You need to spend at least 30 minutes a day studying the market to know what new inventory there is for your buyers and deepening your knowledge of what’s happening in the market so that you aren’t just an agent, you are a Real Market Expert.

I is to improve your skills. This means taking time every single day to work on your craft whether it’s role-play on how to handle objections from buyers and sellers, whether it’s sharpening your skills on your listing or buyer presentation, or understanding how to become a better negotiator, the bottom line is Real Estate offers a seven-figure plus income opportunity. We have the opportunity to get paid like a doctor or a lawyer but the bottom line is if you want to get paid like a pro you have to train like a pro and that means putting in the time to pound on your craft every single day.

T in habit stand stands for thinking ahead to dominate your day. This means taking 5-10 minutes every single day either the night before or at the beginning of the day to not just plan your day, but also identify, quantify, and focus on your top opportunities.

This last habit when you get it right can be a total game changer. Tony Fery was an agent I coached and when Tony started working with me, he was making less than $100,000 a year. Within 18 months of implementing this single habit his income went to over $500,000 a year

And to make this simple [**I’m going to give you a tool to fill out every day to will keep you focused**](https://jennings-dominateyourday.paperform.co/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the opportunities in your business that truly move the needle.

It’s a simple form called “Dominate Your Day” and when you fill it out daily, that’s exactly what will happen.

Here’s the way it works:

Print out a clean copy before you go to bed or first thing in the morning.

Start in the bottom right corner and wright down 10 things you are feeling positive about, excited about, or grateful for.

Why do we do this? Well, it’s scientifically proven that when your mind is in an elevated mood, you have more resources available, and you will stop and think about more opportunities than if you were in a normal or lower mood.

Then you shift your focus to the box in the lower left corner, and you outline all of the things that you need to do, and most importantly, any and all of the client opportunities that are in your world. Alongside each activity or opportunity, you’ll write down a dollar amount of what that translates to in commission for your business.<br><br>Once you’ve done that, you move your attention to the top of the form and take your most valuable opportunities or activities and place them in order in the top section and in the right margin you write what the dollar value of each opportunity is.

It’s very simple, but very powerful. This makes sure that you keep your attention on the opportunities that represent the most value every single day and when you do that, guess what success happens by itself.

This leads us to one simple rule, the rule of three.

Your goal is to set three new client meetings a week and I can tell you from experience when you that you will close somewhere between 16 and 30 transactions a year and in this market that equates to somewhere between $300,000 and $500,000 a year.<br><br>So there you have it that’s how to get your habits right to Thrive in ‘25.

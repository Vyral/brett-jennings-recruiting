Today Iâ€™m sharing the recording of our recent Top Agent Panel. Top agents Lauren Moseley, Natalie Brumley, Nneka Jenkins, Don Mitchell, and I got together to discuss how we grew our real estate businesses during the pandemic. Many other real estate agents joined in on the meeting, but I wanted to be sure to share it with all of you. This health crisis changed many things about the industry, but each panelist thrived during the chaos. You can take our tips and advice and apply them to your own business. Our first topic of discussion was evolving buyer preferences and seller motivations.

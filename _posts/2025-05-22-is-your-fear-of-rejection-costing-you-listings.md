Still putting off your prospecting calls? If you want more listings this spring, it’s time to face the fear and pick up the phone.

I know prospecting can feel awkward. Whether it’s cold calling, knocking on doors, or making small talk at an open house, it’s not exactly the fun part of real estate. But if you want steady business in 2025, this is where the rubber meets the road. Here are three simple ways to make it easier and more natural:<br><br>**1\. Bring value to the call.** Most people won’t pick up the phone just to hear a pitch. So don’t lead with what you want. Lead with something useful. Try this: *‘Hey, I wanted to share a quick update. Did you know your neighborhood’s average home price has gone up 6 percent since last spring?’* Now you’re the local expert bringing something relevant. You’re not selling. You’re informing. That shift makes all the difference.

**2\. Don’t be someone you’re not**. Please don’t turn into the overly scripted robot voice. No one wants to talk to someone who sounds like they’re reading a script for the first time. Use scripts, but make them sound like you. Practice until the words feel natural in your voice. Adjust the tone, pace, and phrasing to match your personality. And if you feel nervous before dialing, take a breath, loosen up, and go for it anyway.

**3\. Don’t go for a Yes. Go for No! Don’t be afraid to fail.** Here’s the truth: this is a numbers game. Some people will hang up. Some won’t call back. That’s part of the job. In fact, if you want a great mindset hack for prospecting look at your numbers and figure out how many people say “no” before you get a “yes” for an appointment. How many appointments do you need to get to a closing, and how much is a closing worth?

When I ran my numbers, I figured out that I need to get 29 “no’s” before I get a “yes” for an appointment. I need 4 appointments to get one closing. That means I have to get 119 “no’s” to land one closing—and the average closing is worth $30,000. So every “no” is actually worth $250 to me.

When someone tells me “no,” I say to myself, “I just made $250.” Sure, it’ll take some time to get paid, but if I stay consistent, I definitely will. So expect rejection, go for “NO,” and get surprised by “YES.”

If you want to get better at this, don’t go solo. As I say its easier to eat your dog food together than on your own, Find someone to roleplay and make your calls with. Practice out loud. Compare notes on what works and what doesn’t. And if you want a practice partner or someone to hold you to you accountable, reach out. Call me, text me, send DM me. Let’s help each other grow this spring and build a business that actually works.

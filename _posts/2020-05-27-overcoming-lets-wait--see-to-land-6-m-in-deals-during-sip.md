Lionel Madamba has succeeded during shelter-in-place and is on his way to generating $6 M in buyers and new listings by showing clients what's happening with the market. I caught up with him recently for a discussion about what he’s been doing differently.

**Feel free to follow along in the video above, or use the timestamps I’ve provided below to navigate the discussion at your leisure:**

1:04- How has Lionel been approaching business differently during the pandemic?

4:10- How giving market updates via Zoom has helped Lionel turn hesitant clients into confident ones

5:30- An example of one of the presentations we put together for our agents and their clients

7:20- Lionel’s advice for agents who might be struggling right now

9:40- Wrapping things up

If you have questions for me about anything we discussed in today’s video or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.

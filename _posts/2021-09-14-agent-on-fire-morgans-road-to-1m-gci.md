Today I’m eager to catch up with Morgan McGuire, one of our newer partners. He’s been with us for about seven months, but he’s not new to real estate. As our latest agent on fire, he’s already done $28 million in sales just since joining us. He’s exceptional in many ways, but success starts with a solid mindset. Growing up, he played an array of sports that taught him to give everything his all because there’s always someone behind you wanting to take your place.

If you’d like to discuss the topics covered in today’s video or want to schedule a strategy session on how to improve your business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Also, **our team is growing, and we’re looking for top-quality agents to join us.** If you’re interested in this opportunity, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.

Here are seven strategies you can use to help your buyers win out in a multiple-offer situation:&nbsp;

**1\. Know the market.** By this I mean you need to study the recent comparable sales and, more importantly, the most recent pending sales.&nbsp;

**2\. Go big or go homeless.** Obviously, you want to make an offer that’s higher than the last known comparable pending sale. If there were four offers on a recent pending sale, that means three buyers who lost out on the home will be looking to offer a higher price the next time around.&nbsp;

**3\. Consider using an escalation clause.** This is an addendum to your client’s purchase agreement that guarantees they’ll offer a higher price than the next highest offer up to a certain amount. Talk to the listing agent before you use this clause, though, because some agents have never seen it before and might not understand how it works.&nbsp;

**4\. Waive as many contingencies as possible.** Get your buyer pre-approved before they make an offer so that they aren’t carrying any loan or appraisal contingencies with them. Many sellers in the Bay Area also do pre-inspections, so if you and your client are comfortable trusting a pre-inspection, you can waive your own inspection contingency. If the seller hasn’t done a pre-inspection, you can still get the inspection contingency waived by asking the listing agent to have it done prior to making your offer.&nbsp;

**5\. Put down a huge earnest money deposit.** A customary earnest money deposit in our area is 3% of the purchase price. If your buyer has the funds, have them put down 10%. Your client’s not taking on any more risk, because the liquidated damages clause maximizes liquidated damages at 3%.

**6\. Write a love letter to the seller.** Writing a love letter has helped our team’s clients win out in a multiple-offer situation even when they didn’t offer the highest price. Have your client include pictures of their own family, and if possible, have them shoot a quick video on their phone that you can then text or email the listing agent.&nbsp;

**7\. Create urgency.** In a quick market like ours, the first person to the party is often the winner. With that in mind, consider sending a pre-emptive offer to the listing agent. They have an obligation to show the seller that offer, so you don’t need to ask permission.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about how to come out on top in a multiple-offer situation, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

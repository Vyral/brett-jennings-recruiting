Being a coach is fantastic, but sometimes, the glory of the game pulls you back onto the field. I recently had the privilege of sitting down with two amazing real estate veterans who left management roles to get back into the action—Julia Cocchi and Chris Rasmussen. In his role as a broker manager running three offices, Chris found himself giving advice to agents that he could have benefited from years ago on the sales side. Meanwhile, the challenges of COVID-19 opened up new sales opportunities for Julia last spring. Now, they’re both having profound success with Real Estate Experts.&nbsp;

This market is insane, right?

120 days ago, interest rates were below 4%, homes were selling in a few days, and taking a listing virtually guaranteed you a paycheck.

Fast forward to today and listings are taking weeks, if not months to sell, and cancellations and expireds are the highest they've been in almost a decade.

Yet, while all of this is happening, there are a handful of listing experts who know how to weather a shifting market, how to price them properly, and most importantly... how to get them SOLD.

To help you do the same, we've assembled a panel of top agents who are going to pull back the curtain and share everything they know -- no holds barred -- about getting and selling listings in a shifting market.

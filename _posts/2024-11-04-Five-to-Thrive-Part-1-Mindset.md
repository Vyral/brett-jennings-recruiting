[**REGISTER HERE FOR OUR 5 TO THRIVE IN 2025 EVENT ON DECEMBER 11TH**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/top-agent-secrets-5-keys-to-thrive-in-2025-tickets-1083491565439?aff=oddtdtcreator){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Welcome back to *5 to Thrive in 2025*! If you’re reading this, it’s because you’re ready to make 2025 your best year yet. And here’s the truth: the first step in getting there has nothing to do with the market or even doing deals. It’s all about what’s going on *right here*—*your mindset*. Having worked for Tony Robbins is a passion of mine because Your mindset will determine at least 80% of your success so let’s dig into what it means to get your mindset right for the year ahead.

So, if you want to thrive in 2025, the first thing you have to do is choose a *positive mindset*. And I say CHOOSE for a reason Let’s be real—real estate is tough. Every day we’re dealing with rejection, setbacks, and challenging situations. If you’re in this game and you’re serious about growth, negativity will always be part of the equation. The difference is how you choose to handle it. Choosing positivity doesn’t mean being pollyanna or pretending there aren’t any problems; it means choosing to see each one as an opportunity and choosing to look for the silver lining in every situation so you bounce back stronger each day.

Alright, so that’s the first element: Choosing a positive mindset. Now, the second step in getting your mindset right is *embracing a growth mindset.* We’ve all seen how fast things can shift in this industry. Our recent Department of Justice lawsuit—was a potent reminder that nothing in this business stays the same, and to stay on top, you have to keep evolving, keep learning, and keep growing. However, the most powerful growth doesn’t just come from responding to changes that are thrown at you, like the DOJ lawsuit. The most powerful growth is fueled by a clear vision and powerful goals.

This means taking time *out of* your business to set your goals—and not only business goals for 2025 but personal goals as well. And why include personal goals? Because your personal goals (Slide 30) are the “WHY” the passion and the purpose behind your business goals. They give you the emotional fuel to drive you toward what you want.

So a question for you…are you clear on your goals and business plan for 2025? If not it’s OK. I’ll provide you an opportunity to dial in your 2025 plan with crystal clarity.

Once you’re clear on your goals, here’s the beauty of a growth mindset: it gives you the courage to pursue those goals fearlessly, knowing you cannot fail.

Wait—did I just say you *cannot fail*? Yes, I did. Because with a growth mindset, there is no failure. There’s no winning and losing. It’s about winning *and* learning. Even when you fall short, you’re still moving forward. When you “fail,” all you’re really experiencing is your *First Attempt* *In* *Learning*. That’s what a growth mindset is all about—it’s failure-free permission to swing for the fences.

The third element of getting your mindset right is (Slide 111)*being client-first*. To thrive in this business, you have to live to make other people’s lives better. When you’re truly committed to helping your clients, they feel it. And you know what? That kind of sincerity is contagious. Your business will grow, just like it has for so many of our partners when people sense that you’re in this for them, embodying a client-first mindset, where success isn’t just about you closing a sale; they feel it and referrals come your way without even asking.

The fourth mindset shift you need to make is to be *more relational and less transactional*. Over the past decade, with low interest rates and a booming market, it was easy to be transactional. Deals were happening left and right just because of the market. But today, that’s not enough. We have to slow down and truly connect with people. Are we in B2B or B2C? No, we are in the H2H business “Human to Human Business”. People want to feel that connection and know you care because ultimately this is a relationship-based business.

Finally, the fifth mindset element: *be a team player*. Gone are the days when agents kept their cards close to the vest, worried that someone else would steal their ideas. From music to media to marketing. We’re in a new era of collaboration, and the agents who thrive now come from collaboration and have an abundance mindset. They know that sharing ideas doesn’t shrink the market—it expands it. The highest-performing agents today are the ones who understand that collaboration opens doors for everyone. When you lift others up, you rise too.

So there you have it—the 5 key elements to getting your mindset right. Choose a positive mindset, embrace growth, stay client-first, focus on relationships, and be a team player. Nail these down, and you’re already on your way to thriving in 2025.

And if you really want to guarantee your success. Join us live in person on December 11 for our 5 to Thrive in ‘25 Business Vision Boot Camp. I’ll take you through the Tony Robbins goal-setting process and help you craft a business plan for 2025 that will assure your success.

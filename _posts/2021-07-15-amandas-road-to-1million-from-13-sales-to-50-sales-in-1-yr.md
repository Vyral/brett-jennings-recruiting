Over the last 12 years, I’ve traveled the country to meet with and mentor some of the brightest minds in the real estate industry. The Agent on Fire series is about discovering amazing Realtors and helping them grow. I’m committed to helping 10 agents earn $1 million in GCI this year. I recently had the privilege to speak with two amazing agents: Amanda Vang and Michael Saldana. Amanda is on track for over 50 sales in 2021 and still maintains a healthy work-life balance. They’re both well on their way to that $1 million goal. To listen to their stories and see how they’ve put their businesses on an amazing trajectory, watch my latest video.

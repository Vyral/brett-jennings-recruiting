[**REGSITER HERE FOR OUR 5 TO THRIVE IN 2025 EVENT ON DECEMBER 11TH**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/top-agent-secrets-5-keys-to-thrive-in-2025-tickets-1083491565439?aff=oddtdtcreator){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

If 2024 wasn’t all you’d hoped for, I’ve got good news for you.

According to market analysts in 2025, the market will come alive.

And even better news is for the agents that are prepared to take advantage of it they will have some of the best years ever.

I’m Brett Jennings and for the last 10 years, I’ve been helping average agents achieve above-average success and great agents achieve outstanding success.

In 2021 I set a goal to help five agents make their first $1 million in real estate and I’m proud to say we helped 13, but what also happened is by setting that goal I also helped 14 agents earn over $500,000 and another 15 agents make over $250,000.

Inadvertently, we achieved another major milestone in real estate by becoming the first team in California to sell over $ 1 billion in a single year.

So if you’re watching this right now, and you want to make 2025 your best year ever, you have to get 5 things right.

Firstly, you have to choose a positive mindset. Let’s face it, real estate is hard. If you’re in this game and want to grow you need to confront negativity and rejection to overcome it, and you have to choose to cultivate a positive mindset every single day.

Secondly, you have to be growth-minded. Our recent industry shake-up with the Department of Justice lawsuit proves to us that nothing in this business stays the same. You have to be constantly learning, growing, and elevating your game if you want to grow to the next level.

When it comes to being growth-minded, there are four core beliefs that you need to have firmly in place which we will cover in our next video.

The second thing you have to get right once you get right is your habits. Pursuing big goals requires keeping your energy high and your attitude positive and that starts with a powerful morning routine.

The next habit you have to cultivate and often the most overlooked factor by struggling agents is building the daily habit of making time to connect with clients, prospects, and leads. If you don’t ground your business in this habit you’re honestly kidding yourself. Jim Rohn summarized this best when he said, “Goals without discipline is the beginning of delusion”. So to grow your business need a powerful daily and weekly routine that starts with business development.

The third thing you have to get right is your systems. Great systems help you do more and do it more consistently and that all starts with a powerful CRM.

The right CRM is used the right way. It will tell you who you need to call and how to follow up.

Great systems also include having a standard process of how you work with buyers and sellers from A-to-Z so that it’s reputable and consistent. It’s a necessary component to set you up for number four.

The fourth thing have to do is get your support right. 80% of real estate is $35/hour work and if you do all that work, you only have 20% of your time for high-value activities and you’ll never get to your bigger income goals. So the first thing you’re doing when getting your support right is that first level of an assistant, which for many agents is a transaction coordinator. But you don’t just want a transaction coordinator, you want someone who’s going to love on your client and that’s what we call client care. That’s someone who’s not just going to check the boxes to make sure your documents and forms are in order, but someone who’s actually going to love on that client and hold their hand through the entire process as an extension of you.

The other part of support you have to get right is having a great marketing assistant or team to grow a big business. You need to constantly remind everyone in your database that you were in the business why because the size of your business is directly proportional to the number of people that know you’re in business and if you’re trying to do this all by yourself when you get busy, it’s the first thing that falls off the plate and you’re back on the real estate roller coaster of having a good month and a bad month.

The last thing you have to get right is your environment. There’s a truth in life that your life (the level of income, enjoyment passion, fun relationships) is the equivalent of the five people you spend the most time with.

And that’s why it’s so important that if you want to go to the next level, you surround yourself with people who are already at that level that you wanna be at. For me, one of my goals was to be the first agent to sell 100 homes in a year. So what did I have to do? I had to go outside of our market to get into relationships with people who are selling hundreds of homes a year. I sat in rooms with people selling 300 and 400 homes a year that weren’t any smarter than I was and at some point, I realized they’re not any different than me. It gave me all the confidence I needed to achieve my goals.

So here’s the deal: getting all of this right sounds like a lot of work, and it especially is if you have to go out and create all of it yourself.

But I’ve got good news for you. You don’t have to. This is exactly why I created the 5 to Thrive series and boot camp.

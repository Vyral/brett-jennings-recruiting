In this training video, you’re getting a look inside how my team is adapting and thriving in this low inventory market. The No. 1 problem agents are facing right now is low inventory. Today I’ll show you how we are getting listings in this market and share our top five strategies for finding them with you. One of the strategies is reaching out to past clients who have bought from you to see if they’re interested in selling.

If you’d like to discuss the topics covered in today’s video or want to schedule a strategy session on how to improve your business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.

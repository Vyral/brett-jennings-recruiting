In our first “Keeping It Real” training video, Brett Jennings joins us to explore strategies for lead generation and direct mail campaigns in higher-end real estate markets. According to Brett, who sells real estate in the affluent area of Silicon Valley, the key to his success comes from exploring the gap between ideas and their implementation. He targets an area with at least 2,000 homes and, after downloading the homeowners’ contact information, sends hand-addressed letters to each one—he even sends one to himself so that he knows when the letters are supposed to have arrived. Three to five days later, the team will begin to follow up. This tact allows his team to acquire listings even in markets with low inventory. For more details about successful direct mail and lead generation tactics, watch the latest installment of “Keeping It Real” with Frank Klesitz.

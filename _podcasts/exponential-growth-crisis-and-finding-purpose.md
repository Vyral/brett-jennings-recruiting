Join Brett Jennings, the founder of Real Estate Experts, and Amy Wienands, President and CEO of Amy Wienands Real Estate, in the first-ever interview on The Real Experts podcast.

Amyâ€™s journey didn't begin with selling houses. Her career began rooted in service, first in psychology and then ministry. However, life's twists and turns led her to real estate, where she's been making a positive impact and achieving extraordinary success for nearly 30 years.


Amy's story is not just about selling houses. Her unique perspective on helping others through challenges to become the best they can be has created a team where everyone loves to work, and clients feel genuinely helped.


Starting with just two agents, her team has now grown to over 45, making  Amy Wienands Real Estate the top team in Iowa for over eight years.


In this episode, Amy reveals how she turned a string of personal challenges into an opportunities for growth, from her health scare to market ups and downs. She shares how these moments made her rethink her goals and focus on what truly matters and how her morning routine, like her walks and visualizations, clear her head and set the direction for the day.


Amy also reveals how learning to hone and work with intuition has lead her to make bold moves that have had a huge impact beyond real estate, like starting a women's event out of the blue. This event was about empowering women to push past doubts and chase their dreams.
